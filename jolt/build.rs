// Pre-build code for zephyr module.

// This module makes the values from the generated .config available as conditional compilation.
// Note that this only applies to the zephyr module, and the user's application will not be able to
// see these definitions.  To make that work, this will need to be moved into a support crate which
// can be invoked by the user's build.rs.

// This builds a program that is run on the compilation host before the code is compiled.  It can
// output configuration settings that affect the compilation.

fn main() {
    zephyr_build::export_bool_kconfig();
