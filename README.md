# David Brown's Keyboard Firmware

This is the firmware for my various
[keyboards](https://github.com/tangybbq/keyboard).  At this point, it isn't the
firmware I regularly run, but is still in development.  It is based on the
[rp2040 project template](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp2040-project-template).

At this point, there is nothing to configure, as it only supports the proto2
keyboard and just prints keypress and release events.
